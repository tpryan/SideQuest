	</header>

	<p>Side Quest is a conference about leveling up developer skills, with 
		untraditional developer topics. Think that public speaking could be a 
		good thing to add to your arsenal? Wondering if office politics can 
		help you? Wondering how craft brewing can expand your developer 
		skills?  This is the conference for you.</p>


	<p>All topics will be told by developers but not directly about 
		development, with a focus on other skills you can harness to drive 
		your development career forward. </p>
