			<p>SideQuest is a conference to level up web workers.</p> 

			<p>Often we make the most progress in our skills, jobs, or careers when we are learning things
				outside our main focus area. After you've attended enough conferences, read enough books, 
				followed enough tutorials, just learning a new language doesn't do it for you.</p>
			<p>That's why there's SideQuest, a conference dedicated to helping you advance yourself in a non obvious way.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Perhaps learning public speaking could help your career, so <a href="">Technical Presentations That 
			Don't Suck</a> could help you.</li>
				<li>The rise of Responsive Web Design has made <a href="">SVG</a> a hot topic these days, learning <a href="">How to Draw SVG Graphics with Illustrator</a> might be a career saver. </li>
				<li>Perhaps you need some advice in going at it along that you could get from <a href="">I Started a Video 
					Game Music Studio in Philadelphia Because I Didn't Want to Move</a> could inspire you. </li>  
			</ul>



			<p>All topics will be spoken by developers but will not necessarily be directly about 
				development, with a focus on other skills you can harness to drive 
				your development career forward. </p>
